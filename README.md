# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) puzzles
using Clojure.

General implementation notes:

* I'm not striving for perfect or particularly impressive
  solutions. This is supposed to be fun, after all!
* I'm not trying to make my code as small as possible, though I
  embrace concision when suitable to the problem at hand.
* I give no consideration to performance except when absolutely
  necessary.
* I've done all development within a REPL, so not all examples will run
  unmodified.
